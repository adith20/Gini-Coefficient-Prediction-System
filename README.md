# Gini-Coefficient-Prediction-System
This project is a part of ***Deep Learning Research Project*** course, completed at ***Purdue University Northwest, United States***.
It deals with the prediction of Gini Coefficient (of the United States) using Deep Learning model and identify its underlying factors.

The dataset was collected from following sources :

https://fred.stlouisfed.org

https://data.oecd.org

## Feature Selection
A correlation matrix for 22 attributes of the original dataset is generated to identify attributes which influence Gini index the most.

![correlation matrix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64524646/227861810-946b1674-76d5-4e36-b15b-a9daa7ceab70.jpg)
It is thereby narrowed down to 6 influencing attributes obtained in [Dataset original](https://github.com/adith20/Gini-Coefficient-Prediction-System/blob/main/Dataset%20original.csv) for Model Prediction.

## Result
The accuracy of prediction turned out to be 95.99 % .
